master (unreleased, subject to change)

v2.0.0 (2009-03-29)
  * Backwards incompatible changes!

  * Reorganized code a bit. Moving away from monolithic file

  * Moved everything under the TabTab namespace

  * Removed the 'active_class' option from helpers. It's easy enough to
    change CSS to use 'active', or to implement a custom 'tab' helper

  * Killed 'tab_helper_helper' in favor of
    'tab_name_helper', 'tab_html_attributes_helper', and
    'test_tab_activaton_status_helper' for people who can't/won't
    use the built-in 'tab' helper.

v1.1.0 (2009-02-12)
  * Introduced 'tabs_for' helper for nested tabs

v1.0.0 (2009-02-11)
  * First version!
