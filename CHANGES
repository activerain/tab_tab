master (unreleased, subject to change)
  * Reorganized code a bit. Moving away from monolithic file
  * Backwards incompatible changes!
    * Moved everything under the TabTab namespace
    * Killed 'tab_helper_helper' in favor of
      'tab_name_helper' and 'tab_html_attributes_helper'.
    * Removed the 'active_class' option from helpers. It's easy enough to
      change CSS to use 'active', or to implement a custom 'tab' helper

v1.1.0 (2009-02-12)
  * Introduced 'tabs_for' helper for nested tabs

v1.0.0 (2009-02-11)
  * First version!
